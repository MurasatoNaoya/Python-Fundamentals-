# Modules are other .py scripts that caled be called within your own .py script. 
# Packages are therefore a collection of modules.

# You can create another .py file that has one function, using 'import' you can retrieve that function as a module into your other .py script. 
# The .py file from which you imported the function, would be a MODULE. 

from module_example import my_func # Do note that you have to follow syntax for the module name.
