# All of the modules that we have dealt with so far, have been inbilt modules within Python. 
# The modules we have at the moment are useful, but there are many more across the internet that make it possible for us to do many other things. 
# Pypi is a collection of such modules and latger libraries, that expand out capabilities within Python. 

# The general form of downloading something from PyPi will be as follows (This is done on the comand line, rather than Python terminal) - 
# pip install (modules/library name) 


# To find packages that you might want to work with, just search something along the lines of - 'PyPi _____'.
